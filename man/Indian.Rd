\description{
Panel data on 14 paddy farmers from Aurepalle, India, collected over ten years (1975–76 to 1984–85). Includes farmer characteristics (age, schooling) and production variables (output, land, labour, bullocks, input costs).
}
\usage{data("Indian")}
\format{
  A data frame with 273 observations (an unbalanced panel of observations on 34 farmers over 10 years) on the following 10 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{id}}{a numeric vector containing a unique identifier for each farmer}
    \item{\code{yr}}{a numeric vector containing the year of the observation}
    \item{\code{age}}{a numeric vector containing the age of the primary decision maker}
    \item{\code{school}}{a numeric vector containing the number of years of schooling of the primary decision maker}
    \item{\code{yvar}}{a numeric vector containing the natural logarithm of the total value of output (rupees)}
    \item{\code{Lland}}{a numeric vector containing the natural logarithm of the total area of land operated (ha)}
    \item{\code{PIland}}{a numeric vector containing the proportion of land that is irrigated}
    \item{\code{Llabor}}{a numeric vector containing the natural logarithm of the total number of hours of hired and family labour used}
    \item{\code{Lbull}}{a numeric vector containing the natural logarithm of the number of hours of bullock labour used}
    \item{\code{Lcost}}{a numeric vector containing the natural logarithm of the value of inputs including fertiliser, manure, pesticides, machinery, etc.}
